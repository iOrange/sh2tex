# bcdec
Small header-only C library to decompress any BC compressed image inspired by incredible stb libaries (<http://nothings.org/stb>)

Written by Sergii *"iOrange"* Kudlai in 2022.

This library provides functions to decompress blocks of BC compressed images.  

This library does not allocate memory and is trying to use as less stack as possible.

The library was never optimized specifically for speed but for the overall size.  
It has zero external dependencies and is not using any runtime functions.

### Supported BC formats:
- BC1 (also known as DXT1) + it's "binary alpha" variant BC1A (DXT1A)
- BC2 (also known as DXT3)
- BC3 (also known as DXT5)
- BC4 (also known as ATI1N)
- BC5 (also known as ATI2N)
- BC6H (HDR format)
- BC7

BC1/BC2/BC3/BC7 are expected to decompress into 4\*4 RGBA blocks 8bit per component (32bit pixel)  
BC4/BC5 are expected to decompress into 4\*4 R/RG blocks 8bit per component (8bit and 16bit pixel)  
BC6H is expected to decompress into 4*4 RGB blocks of either 32bit float or 16bit "half" per
component (96bit or 48bit pixel)

You will also find included test program that converts compressed DDS files into TGA/HDR.  
It is a good start to learn on how to use the **bcdec** library.  
It comes with some test images in the *test_images* folder and a batch script *test_bcdec.bat* to run over them.
